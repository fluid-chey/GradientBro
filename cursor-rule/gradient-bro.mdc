# GradientBro — Gradient Generation

## When to Activate

Trigger when the user mentions any of the following:

- "generate a gradient", "create a gradient", "make a gradient"
- "replicate this gradient", "replicate this background"
- "gradient like this", "background like this"
- "textured background", "noisy gradient", "grainy gradient"
- "match this gradient", "copy this gradient"
- Attaches an image and asks for a gradient or background based on it

## What to Do

Read and follow the skill at `~/.cursor/skills/gradient-bro/SKILL.md` immediately.

The skill will guide you through:
1. Ensuring the `gradient-bro` CLI tool is installed
2. Analysing the reference image
3. Generating layered CSS (gradients + noise + blur + blend modes)
4. Placing the code in the correct location for the project
5. Supporting iterative refinement

## Important

- All gradient output must be pure CSS + inline SVG — zero image assets.
- Place generated code directly in the user's project at the location they specify.
- Support refinement requests ("more grain", "shift the warm spot") by editing the existing CSS.
